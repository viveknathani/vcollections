# vcollections

vcollections is a home grown library of data structures to teach myself Rust.

## motivation

I think writing data structures from scratch is a great way to understand a programming language. You are forced to think how memory works. If you try to make them thread-safe, you are forced to look into synchronisation primitives offered by the language. And it only takes a few hours to code most of these data structures individually.

## supported data structures

1. [Singly Linked List](./src/linked_list/)

## license

[MIT](./LICENSE)

Happy hacking!
